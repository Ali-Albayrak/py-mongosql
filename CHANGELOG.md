## 2.0.6 (2019-09-14)
* `bundled_project` are now loaded quietly (meaning, they are loaded, but not included into the projection)
* `MongoQuerySettingsDict.pluck_from()`: now skips the `max_items` key because it does not make sense when inherited
* Bugfix: in some cases, the `projection` property returned invalid results

## 2.0.5 (2019-08-27)
* `ensure_loaded` setting for projections

## 2.0.4 (2019-07-26)
* `filter`: new `$prefix` operator
* `AssociationProxy` support for `project` and `filter`
* `MongoQuery.get_final_query_object()` method for debugging
* Project Handler: the new `default_projection` behavior lets you build APIs that return no fields by default:
    the API user will have to require every field explicitly.

## 2.0.3 (2019-07-06)
* CrudHelper is not able to save `@property` values: welcome `writable_properties`!
* Fix: `bundled_project` now takes care of `force_include`d fields as well
* Recommendation when a legacy column is removed: use `legacy_fields` together with `force_include` 
    on a `@property` that fakes the missing column or relationship.
* CrudHelper now removes `legacy_fields` from the input dict
* `legacy_fields` are now included into all projections generated by `project` and `join` handlers

## 2.0.2 (2019-06-29)
* `legacy_fields` setting will make handlers ignore certain fields that are not available anymore.
    Works with: `filter`, `sort`, `group`, `join`, `joinf`, `aggregate`.
* `method_decorator` has had a few improvements that no one would notice

## 2.0.0 (2019-06-18)
* Version 2.0 is released!
* Complete redesign
* Query Object format is the same: backwards-compatible
* `outerjoin` is renamed to `join`, old buggy `join` is now `joinf`
* `join` is not handled by a tweaked `selectin` loader, which is a lot easier and faster!
* Overall 1.5x-2.5x performance improvement
* `MongoQuery` settings lets you configure everything
* `StrictCrudHelper` is much more powerful
* `@saves_relations` helps with saving related entities
* `MongoQuery.end_count()` counts and selects at the same time
